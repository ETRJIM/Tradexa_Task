# Tradexa_Task
It is a simple post+product app where users can post advertisements,blogs other stuff as well as the products can also be posted separately.
I have used 2 separate databases one for User and Post other being used for Products, The routers files have been configured to prevent the mixing of the databases and ambigiousness for the system, the templates of corresponding app are put into the corresponding folder.

# Userposts
In this app I have used built-in UserCreationForm with some customisation to register a new user, Posts Model is also implemented into this app only used to keep the track of posts posted on the blog, Registered Users can only write blogs and they can also edit or delete the posts wrote by them, unregistered users can read the posts and can connect to authors by the email.

# Products
Products Model is also implemented into this app only used to keep the track of Products posted on the product interface, Registered Users can only post products they can also edit or delete the products unregistered users can view the products with the tag of their price and weight
